AQI, Air Quality Index measurements, leaving lockdown

### In which
AQI records are harvested from www.waqi.info for a geographical rectangle covering Great Britain and Ireland to compare with indices relating to pollution and public health.

### The goal
is to explore if it is worth paying for the air we breathe. Everyone buys the food they eat, what they drink, but not the air they breathe. I think the consequence of this is that there are high standards for food and drink but air is polluted to a far worse extent. There will be a tie-in to current ecological concerns and urban living along the way.
